## Pattern Matching Reference

The AI uses pattern matching to understand your queries. Here are the key patterns:

| Pattern | Keywords |
|---------|----------|
| Overdue | overdue, past due, late |
| Revenue | revenue, income, earnings, total paid |
| Draft | draft |
| Sent | sent, pending, outstanding |
| Customer | customer, client |
| Status | status, count, how many |
| Create | create invoice, new invoice |
| Reminder | send reminder, reminder |
| Help | help, what can you do |

## Limitations

The AI Chat Assistant currently:
- Does **NOT** execute actions (create invoices, send emails, etc.)
- Does **NOT** modify data - it only provides information and instructions
- Uses template-based pattern matching, not advanced AI language models
- Works best with the predefined query patterns listed above

For unsupported queries, the AI will provide helpful suggestions for what it can do.

## Need More Help?

If you have a question the AI can't answer, you can:
1. Try rephrasing your question using different keywords
2. Ask "What can you do?" to see all capabilities
3. Use the main InvoiceMe interface for direct actions
4. Consult the user documentation

**Remember:** The AI Chat Assistant is designed to help you quickly get information about your invoices and customers. For creating, editing, or sending invoices, use the main application interface.
